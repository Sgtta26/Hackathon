He llo sara this is your hackaton feedback. The game is ok. Is good that you make a project at least. I will recommend 
instead of using so many elif statments to make a switch statment for the different number on the dice. Also to add
a little of reality to the game making the user to press enter or some key to roll the dice each time. 
It is simple and not using any advanced feature of python. You could even make a class dice game or something like 
that to manage the different functions in a more DRY way. 

Thanks for sharing your project.
